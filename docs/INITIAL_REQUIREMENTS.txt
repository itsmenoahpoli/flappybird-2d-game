Course Project Specifications

Type of Test: Game Development
In this hands-on examination, students will create a Flappy Bird - like game clone using Unity. Flappy Bird is a popular and simple 2D mobile game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird flap its wings. The objective is to keep the bird flying as long as possible without colliding with the pipes. This test will assess students based on their skills in 2D game development, including level design, animation, character design and movement, collision detection, scoring, and game over conditions.

Duration: 2-3 hours
